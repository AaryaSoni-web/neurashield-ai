This can lead to information disclosure and increased attack surface.\n\nStep 2: Assess Exploitability - Exploiting this vulnerability is easy as it requires no special prerequisites other than network access to the server. It can be exploited remotely if the server is exposed to the internet.\n\nStep 3: Determine Impact (CIA Triad) - Confidentiality: Partial, as debug mode can leak sensitive information. Integrity: None, as this configuration does not directly allow data modification. Availability: Partial, as exposing the application can lead to potential DoS attacks.\n\nStep 4: Provide Specific Fix - The fix involves configuring the application to run on localhost and disabling debug mode in production. Additional recommendations include using environment variables for configuration and implementing network security measures.",

Using a database would address these concerns. Additionally, without concurrency control, the list operations could lead to race conditions in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nStep 3: Using Flask's jsonify function ensures consistent and proper JSON responses, which is a more Pythonic and Flask-idiomatic approach.\n\nStep 4: The global list can lead to memory accumulation if not managed properly.
